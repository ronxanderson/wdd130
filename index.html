            Hello, I am Ron Anderson from Highland, Utah. I enjoy travel adventures. Here I am with
            my wife and
            children, when our adult daughters visited us while we were serving as full-time senior
            missionaries
            at the BYU-Pathway Worldwide Global Education Center in Johannesburg, South Africa in
            December 2025. I am learning web development to keep my mind sharp and because of the
            joy that comes
            from learning new things. I am a lifelong student and plan to learn a lot more!
