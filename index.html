            Hello, I am Ron Anderson from Highland, Utah. I enjoy travel adventures. Here I am with
            my wife and
            children, when our adult daughters visited us while we were serving as full-time senior
            missionaries
            at the BYU-Pathway Worldwide Global Education Center in Johannesburg, South Africa, in
            December 2025. I am learning web development to keep my mind sharp and because of the
            sense of satisfaction that comes from learning something that has so changed our world.
            I
            am a
            lifelong student
            and plan to continue learning more!
